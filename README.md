Live tickets will be visible to agents in the agent panel. The relevant SLAs will be assigned by queue managers along with priority tickets to the right agents.

<p>
We are setting the ticket's priority level in this example. Since we are addressing a problem that may have a significant impact on a large area of the business, the priority has been set to Emergency. The SLA plan has been modified, and the ticket has been given to a highly qualified technician in the right department. Some ticketing systems allow customers to modify their own SLA plans.

<p>
Agents are able to communicate with customers, in this case Kyle contacted Karen and will be resolving the issue.
</p>

Once the agent has resolved the issue they can change the ticket status to resolve, the ticket will then be closed and can be viewed by naviagting to Tickets >> Closed
